# Pascal's Triangle Generator

def pascal_triangle(n):   
   
    if n <= 0:
        
        return []
        
    triangle = [[1]]
    for i in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        for j in range(1, i):
            row.append(triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j])
        row.append(1)
        triangle.append(row)

Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical concept that produces a triangular array of binomial coefficients. This README will guide you through creating a Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## What is Pascal’s Triangle?

Pascal’s Triangle is an infinite triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It has many interesting properties and applications in various fields of mathematics and computer science.

## Resources

To gain a deeper understanding of Pascal’s Triangle, consider exploring the following resources:

- [What is Pascal’s Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)
- [Pascal’s Triangle - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMriWTvPXHI)
- [Python Algorithms](https://www.python.org/about/apps/)
- [Mock Technical Interview](https://www.pramp.com/#/)

## Must Know

Before diving into the project, ensure you're familiar with the following Python concepts:

- **Lists and List Comprehensions:**
- Understand list manipulation techniques and how to use list comprehensions effectively.
- **Functions:**
-  Define, call, and return values from functions.
- **Loops:**
- Utilize for and while loops, including nested loops for complex iterations.
- **Conditional Statements:**
-  Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logical branching.
- **Recursion (Optional):**
-  While not mandatory, understanding recursion can offer alternative solutions.
- **Arithmetic Operations:**
-  Perform basic arithmetic operations, especially addition.
- **Indexing and Slicing:**
-  Access elements and slices of lists.
- **Memory Management:**
-  Be mindful of memory usage, especially when dealing with large data structures.
- **Error and Exception Handling
 (Optional):**
-  Use try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully.
- **Efficiency and Optimization:**
- Consider time and space complexity, and optimize your solution for performance.

## Implementation

Now that you're equipped with the necessary knowledge, dive into implementing the Pascal's Triangle generator function. Ensure you understand how to generate rows of the triangle using lists and list comprehensions, and how to efficiently calculate each element based on the previous row.

Feel free to explore different approaches, optimize your solution, and handle potential errors gracefully. Happy coding!
